# What is an Agent?  What is an AI agent? What is an Agentic AI Agent?

Great trio of questions — these terms all sound similar but refer to progressively more specific ideas:
```

## 🧩 1. What is an Agent (in general)?

An Agent is any entity that:

Perceives its environment,

Decides what to do,

And then acts to achieve a goal.

You can think of an agent as something that has autonomy and purpose.
In computing, a “software agent” could be a program that monitors your inbox and automatically files messages, or a web crawler that indexes pages.
In philosophy or robotics, an agent is simply a system that acts intentionally.

## 🤖 2. What is an AI Agent?

An AI Agent extends the general idea to use artificial intelligence — meaning it:

Takes input (text, images, data, etc.),

Uses an AI model (like an LLM, or decision system) to reason or plan,

And then performs actions — such as sending an email, writing code, querying a database, or calling APIs.

Modern AI agents often have:

Memory – they remember previous context or sessions.

Tools / APIs – they can call external systems.

Reasoning ability – they decide which tools to use and when.

Goals / tasks – they work toward user-specified objectives (e.g., “research this topic and draft a summary”).

Frameworks like LangChain, AutoGPT, and CrewAI are examples of systems that orchestrate LLM-based agents.

## 🧠 3. What is an Agentic Agent (or Agentic AI)?

“Agentic” refers to self-directed behavior — the ability to plan, reason, and act over time with minimal human prompting.

An Agentic AI (or Agentic Agent) is an AI system that not only responds to inputs but can:

Set sub-goals, plan multi-step actions,

Reflect on its progress (“Did that work?”),

Adapt its strategy,

And operate autonomously for extended tasks.

This is a step toward continuous, goal-driven AI — sometimes described as “AI that acts like a coworker, not a chatbot.”

## 📊 Agent Summary Table
### 🧠 Agent vs AI Agent vs Agentic Agent

| **Term** | **Core Idea** | **Key Abilities** | **Example** |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Agent** | An entity that perceives its environment and acts toward a goal | Perception, simple action, rule-based behavior | A thermostat that senses room temperature and adjusts heating or cooling |
| **AI Agent** | Uses artificial intelligence to make decisions, reason, and act intelligently | Context awareness, reasoning, learning, tool/API use | A chatbot that books flights, queries APIs, or summarizes documents |
| **Agentic Agent / Agentic AI** | Autonomous, reflective, goal-driven AI capable of planning and adapting over time | Long-term memory, planning, self-reflection, autonomy, adaptability | An AI project manager that plans tasks, delegates work, and adjusts goals dynamically |


## 💡The Big Idea! 
- **Agent:** simple sense → act loop  
- **AI Agent:** adds reasoning & tool use  
- **Agentic Agent:** adds planning, self-reflection, and adaptive autonomy
